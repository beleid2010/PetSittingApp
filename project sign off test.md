## App Overview
The user will be able to create an account and post pet sitting jobs. The job posts require a general location, a job description, a pet description, time frame, and a wage. The wage can either be monetary or free room and board at their home. Once a job is posted it will be visible on a list or on a map. It will appear as pending until a sitter books the job. The user can also view all their posts on their profile.

The purpose of PetIT is to lessen the burden of trying to find care for your pets. Sometimes pet owners are unable to travel with their pets and need a trustworthy place to obtain care. No matter how big or small the task may be, PetIt will allow pet owners the opportunity to find appropriate care for their pets.
